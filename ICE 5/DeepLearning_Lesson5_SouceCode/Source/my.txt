THE BEST MOMENT in any Call of Duty game might be in the franchise's very first title. It's set, like all those early installments, during World War II; in the sequence, your character is a Russian recruit, sent across the Volga River to attack the Germans during the Battle of Stalingrad. Due to a supply shortage, though, you have no gun, and getting one takes longer than is comfortable. Much longer.You rush through the cramped battlefield, dodging machine gun fire as you move from cover to cover. All around you, men dieâ€”as many men as the game engines of 2003 could push onto the screen. The harrowing setpiece manages a tricky balance: it's thrilling, while still showcasing how horrible it would have been to actually be at the Battle of Stalingrad.
